## Key Features

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js API, connected to MongoDB Atlas
- **Frontend**: React.js SPA, deployed to Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing, build, and deployment via GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Example monitoring scripts and configurations included
- **Environment Management**: `.env.example` templates provided

Backend Options:

Render (free tier, easy setup)

Railway (developer-friendly, generous free tier)

Heroku (well-established, extensive docs)

Frontend Options:

Vercel (optimized for React apps)

Netlify (static site deployment with CI/CD)

GitHub Pages (free and integrated with GitHub)

CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflows are included for:

frontend-ci.yml: Testing and building the frontend

backend-ci.yml: Testing the backend

frontend-cd.yml: Deploying the frontend

backend-cd.yml: Deploying the backend

These pipelines automate the testing, building, and deployment processes to ensure smooth and reliable updates to the application.
